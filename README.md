# Taxi Planning
This exercise involves modeling a sequential decision-making problem. We consider the Taxi
Domain problem that involves controlling a taxi agent that can pick up and drop passengers in a
grid world. We will implement algorithms for arriving at a good policy offline using dynamic
programming and later implement basic reinforcement learning methods for online learning. For more details about the problem statement see `\Markov-Decision-Processes`

## Instructions
* Simple command `python A3.py` can be used to run the file.
